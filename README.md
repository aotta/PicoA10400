Gerbers file are provided for the PCB, add you pico clone, and flash the firmware ".uf2" in the Pico by connecting it while pressing button on Pico and drop it in the opened windows on PC.
After flashed with firmware, and every time you have to change your ROMS repository, you can simply connect the Pico to PC and drag&drop "BIN" files  into.

**NOTE 2** Due to different timing of PicoA10400, the flashcart MUST BE POWERED ON (with POWER SWITCH ON CART) BEFORE POWERING THE CONSOLE!!! Also, some games and ALL A7800 GAMES NEEDS THAT THE CONSOLE IS POWERED OFF THEN POWERED ON TO START!!!!

Even if the diode should protect your console, **DO NOT CONNECT PICO WHILE INSERTED IN A POWERED ON CONSOLE!**
